In this project, users can open a new bank account by completing a detailed application process. The information provided by the user is securely stored in a database. Upon successful completion, the application generates a unique ID and PIN for each user, which they can use to log in to the application.

Once logged in, the application offers an ATM simulation with features such as:

1. Deposit: Users can add funds to their account.
2. Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their account.
3. Fast Cash: A quick withdrawal option for preset amounts.
4. PIN Change: Users can update their PIN for security purposes.
5. Balance Enquiry: Users can check their current account balance.
6. Mini Statement: Users can view a brief summary of recentÂ transactions.
